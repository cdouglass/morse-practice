# Principles

Teaches decoding Morse code, using a rough version of the Koch method and Farnsworth timing as described in [http://www.justlearnmorsecode.com/](http://www.justlearnmorsecode.com/) (which also provides Windows software with many more features).

# Setup

Uses the `beep` utility to make sounds, so probably needs Linux.

Beep volume is set separately from normal volume in Alsamixer. You will probably want to lower it before using this program.

```
$ sudo apt-get install beep
```

# Operation

```
$ cargo run
```
